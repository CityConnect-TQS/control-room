# CityConnect

This project is undertaken as part of the TQS course, with the goal of developing a MVP product while applying software enterprise architecture patterns, specifying and enforcing a Software Quality Assurance (SQA) strategy and applying Continuous Testing, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery practices. The chosen theme was a bus service, like the ones you found in common transportation terminals. This is a digital service which includes a customer portal, tools for staff to edit bus and trips information and a digital signage system.
Our project aligns with these goals by focusing on the development of a user-centered online system for a public bus service, with the advantage of unifying these digital services into one.
