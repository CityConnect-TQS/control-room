# CityConnect

![example workflow](https://github.com/CityConnect-TQS/control-room/actions/workflows/deploy.yaml/badge.svg)

This project is undertaken as part of the TQS course, with the goal of developing an MVP product while applying software
enterprise architecture patterns, specifying and enforcing a Software Quality Assurance (SQA) strategy and applying
Continuous Testing, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery practices.
The chosen theme was a bus service, like the ones you found in common transportation terminals.
This is a digital service that includes a customer portal,
tools for staff to edit bus and trip information and a digital signage system.

Our project aligns with these goals by focusing on the development of a user-centered online system for a public bus
service, with the advantage of unifying these digital services into one.
